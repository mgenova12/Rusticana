# Rusticana Pizza

Rusticana Pizza is small family owned business. This website was designed to give the user a glimpse of the restaurant. Also includes admin tools to dynamically change specials. 

# Motivation
Most small businesses suffer from an online presence. This site is meant to help brand the business and reach out to new customers. By implementing an admin panel, the owner can easily keep weekly specials up to date. 

# Tech

Rusticana Pizza uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Ruby on Rails] - Server-side web application framework written in Ruby
* [VueJS] - The Progressive JavaScript Framework
* [Bootstap] - The most popular HTML, CSS, and JS library in the world
* [PostgreSQL] - Powerful, open source object-relational database system
* [Bcrypt] -  A password hashing function
* [Paper Clip] - Easy file attachment library for ActiveRecord
* [Jbuilder] - Generates JSON objects with a Builder-style DSL
